Introduction
------------
Install OpenERP software (Server, Client and Web) on your Ubuntu system.
Currently install OpenERP 6.0.2
These install files are not intended to be elegant, merely functional.
The impetus for writing these files was the sheer number of manual steps
required in
http://doc.openerp.com/v6.0/install/index.html#installation-link

Requirements
------------
I tested with a fairly vanilla Ubuntu 10.04 LTS installation.
2.6.32-28-generic-pae #55-Ubuntu SMP Mon Jan 10 22:34:08 UTC 2011 i686 GNU/Linux
Check yours with 'uname -rvmo'
Your mileage may vary.

install_openERP_server.sh
-------------------------
Installs PostgreSQL and the OpenERP Server on your host.
Creates a Postgres superuser "openerp" with password of "postgres" to get you
started. These settings (db_user, db_password and db_host) are added as options
to the OpenERP Server rc file, ".openerp_serverrc".

Usage: install_openERP_server.sh
Creates a log file in your home directory. You can watch it by typing:
	tail -f ~/openERP_server_install.log


install_openERP_client.sh
-------------------------

install_openERP_web.sh
----------------------

To-Do
-----

Each install file spits all output (stderr and stout) to a named logfile.
OpenERP Server and OpenERP Web restart after reboots
OpenERP Server and OpenERP Web log files are properly stored, rotated & maintained
